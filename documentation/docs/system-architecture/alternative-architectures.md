# Alternative Architectures
Currently, our architecture utilizes several serverless cloud tools to facilitate our application workflow. Our class diagram is also shown at the top of this document detailing our class managers for video, quizzes, and users.

In the case that our application architecture needs to pivot, we briefly provide below alternative architectures
<ul>
        <li>Architectures</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>Monolithic: A single application to handle all functions, with one Node.js backend, a database such as MySQL, and Next.js frontend.</li>
                </ul>
        <li>Tools</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>Frameworks: Vue.js, React.js, Gatsby, HTML Static Site</li>
                        <li>Storage: Other storage APIs such as Firebase may provide us with features that AWS does not currently support</li>
                </ul>
</ul>
Our non-functional requirements are detailed on our Docusaurus page.
