<h2> Description </h2>

This diagram shows a Next.js app that allows users to interact with media content for learning. Users will view videos and answer Multiple Choice Questions on them. The MCQs are held within an S3 bucket. User performance on MCQs will be stored into a MongoDB table. They will be able to see their performance results at the end of each video.
